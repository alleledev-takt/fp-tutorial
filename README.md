A series of worked out problems demonstrating ideas like:

* basic type system terminology and usage
* parametric polymorphism (functions that can operate on any types)
* pattern-matching and exhaustivity analysis
* - and possibly some real-world examples!

Examples will be a mix of Haskell and Scala.

## Building

To build haskell solutions:

* install [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/), the Haskell build tool
* run: `stack setup` to get a compiler
* run: `stack build` to build the code
* run: `stack ghci` to get a command line REPL to play with it
